Many CSV libraries come with built-in support for mapping CSV records to Java beans.
While this is a convenient feature, the reflection-based approach used by most libraries comes with

Thanks to Java stream mapping, FastCSV can provide a similar feature without sacrificing performance.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to map CSV records to Java beans using FastCSV.
