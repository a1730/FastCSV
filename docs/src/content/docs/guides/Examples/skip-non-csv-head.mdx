title: Skip non-CSV head
---

import SourceExample from '../../../../components/SourceExample.astro';

Some CSV files contain one or more lines of text before the actual CSV data starts.
For example, it could look like this:

```
// example.csv
This is an example of a CSV file that contains
three lines before the actual CSV records.

header 1,header 2
value 1,value 2
```

Strictly speaking, such a file **is not a valid CSV file** as defined by the CSV specification
([RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180)).

The main problem with those files is:

- An exception would be thrown unless the options `ignoreDifferentFieldCount()` and `skipEmptyLines()` are set.
- When working with named fields, the very first line (*This is an example of a CSV file that contains*)
  would be interpreted as the actual header line.

FastCSV itself does currently not provide a way to skip non-CSV head lines when reading a CSV file.
However, you can skip non-CSV head lines by reading the file line by line and only hand over to FastCSV
when the actual CSV data starts. This could be done based on a fixed number of lines or by detecting
the actual CSV data.

:::note
Do not mix this with comments in CSV files. Comments are lines that start with a specific character
(e.g., `#`) and can be skipped by FastCSV using a `CommentStrategy`.
See the example on how to [handle comments](/guides/examples/handle-comments/) for more information.

This example demonstrates how to skip non-CSV head lines when reading such a CSV file with FastCSV.
