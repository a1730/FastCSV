The CSV specification ([section 2.4. of RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180#section-2)) explicitly states:

> Spaces are considered part of a field and should not be ignored.

However, in some cases, you might want to remove leading and trailing spaces from fields while reading a CSV file
or modify the fields in another way (e.g., converting them to lower- or uppercase). FastCSV allows you to do this
using a field modifier that can be used together with a `CsvRecordHandler`.

:::tip
If you want to read fields not as string but as a specific type (e.g., `Boolean`, `Long`, `LocalDate`, etc.),
you should check out the [Custom Callback handler example](/guides/examples/custom-callback-handler/).

## Example

In the following example, fields are modified while reading a CSV file.
