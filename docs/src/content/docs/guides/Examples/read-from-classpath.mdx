title: Read from classpath

import SourceExample from '../../../../components/SourceExample.astro';

As you can pass any `java.io.Reader` to the `CsvReader` class, you can read CSV data from any source that
provides a `Reader` or can be converted to a `Reader`.
This includes reading from the classpath.

## Example

In the following example, a CSV file is read from the classpath.

<SourceExample filename="ExampleCsvReaderWithClasspathInput.java"/>
