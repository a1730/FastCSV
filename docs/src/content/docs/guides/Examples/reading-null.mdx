title: Reading null values

import SourceExample from '../../../../components/SourceExample.astro';

The concept of **null values** is not part of the CSV standard (per [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180)).

In some situations, however, it is necessary to interpret certain fields as null values and differentiate them from empty fields.
One common example is database imports and exports, where the differentiation between null and empty fields is often required.

A core principle of FastCSV is to provide a null-free API, meaning that no public function ever returns null.
This design choice helps prevent `NullPointerException` and makes user code more robust.

This feature comes with a trade-off: if you absolutely need null values, you will have to implement a workaround.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to interpret unquoted empty fields as null values by using a custom `FieldModifier`
that carries the information of `null` in a special marker String value.
