title: Byte order mark (BOM) header

import SourceExample from '../../../../components/SourceExample.astro';

FastCSV is capable of reading CSV files with a [Byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
(BOM) header.

:::note
A byte order mark (BOM) is a sequence of 2 to 4 bytes at the start of a text file
that serves as a header to indicate the file's Unicode encoding, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
For UTF-16 and UTF-32, the BOM header also indicates the byte order (big-endian or little-endian).

While UTF-8 is the standard encoding for most text files today,
some applications (like Microsoft Excel) still use the BOM header to explicitly specify the file's encoding.
:::

Enabling automatic BOM header detection can impact performance.
Due to the decreased usage of BOM headers in modern applications, BOM header detection is disabled by default.
To enable BOM header detection, use the `detectBomHeader` method of the `CsvReaderBuilder` class.

You may also want to check out the corresponding
[Javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.siegmar/fastcsv/latest/de.siegmar.fastcsv/de/siegmar/fastcsv/reader/CsvReader.CsvReaderBuilder.html#detectBomHeader(boolean))
for more information.

The following table shows the BOM headers for different Unicode encodings that FastCSV can detect:

| Encoding    | BOM header (hex) |
|-------------|------------------|
| UTF-8       | `EF BB BF`       |
| UTF-16 (BE) | `FE FF`          |
| UTF-16 (LE) | `FF FE`          |
| UTF-32 (BE) | `00 00 FE FF`    |
| UTF-32 (LE) | `FF FE 00 00`    |

The UTF-8 BOM header is the most common one that is also used by Microsoft Excel.

## Example

In the following example, a CSV file with a BOM header is created and read using FastCSV.

<SourceExample filename="ExampleCsvReaderWithBomHeader.java" highlights={['.detectBomHeader(true)']}/>

:::tip
To **create** CSV files with a BOM header using FastCSV, you have to write the BOM header manually,
as shown in the example. FastCSV does not support creating CSV files with a BOM header by itself.
