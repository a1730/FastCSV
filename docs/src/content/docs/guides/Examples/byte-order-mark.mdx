FastCSV is capable of reading CSV files with a [Byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
(BOM) header.

:::note
A BOM header is a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a text file that indicates the file's encoding,
such as UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
Although UTF-8 is the default encoding for most text files today,
some applications still use the BOM header to specify the file's encoding.
:::

Enabling automatic BOM header detection can impact performance
Due to the decreased usage of BOM headers in modern applications, BOM header detection is disabled by default.
To enable BOM header detection, use the `detectBomHeader` method of the `CsvReaderBuilder` class.

You may also want to check out the corresponding
[Javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.siegmar/fastcsv/latest/de.siegmar.fastcsv/de/siegmar/fastcsv/reader/CsvReader.CsvReaderBuilder.html#detectBomHeader(boolean))
for more information.

## Example

In the following example, a CSV file with a BOM header is created and read using FastCSV.

<Code code={sourceCode} title="ExampleCsvReaderWithBomHeader.java" lang="java" mark={highlights}/>

:::tip
To **create** CSV files with a BOM header using FastCSV, you have to write the BOM header manually,
as shown in the example. FastCSV does not support creating CSV files with a BOM header by itself.
