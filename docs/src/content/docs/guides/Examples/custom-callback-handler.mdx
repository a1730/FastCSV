title: Custom callback handler

The typical way to read CSV data with FastCSV is to either use one of the `ofCsvRecord()` or `ofNamedCsvRecord()`
methods of the `CsvReader` class. Those methods provide convenient access to the CSV data as a stream of
`CsvRecord` or `NamedCsvRecord` objects.

Under the hood, FastCSV uses a callback handler to process the CSV data. The callback handler is responsible for
processing the CSV data and to materialize the objects that represent the CSV records.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to read CSV data using a custom callback handler. This allows you to
process the CSV data in a more flexible way.
