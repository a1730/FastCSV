title: Handle comments
---

import SourceExample from '../../../../components/SourceExample.astro';

Although comments are not part of the CSV standard (per [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180)),
many applications make use of comments in CSV files to provide additional information or to add context to the data.

:::note
Most commonly, comments in CSV files are denoted by a `#` (hash) character at the beginning of a line. This is also
the default comment character used by FastCSV when reading or writing CSV files, but you can change that by
calling the `commentCharacter(char)` method on the `CsvReaderBuilder` or `CsvWriterBuilder` class.
:::

A simple example of a CSV file with comments is shown below:

```
#This is a comment
field 1,field 2,field 3
```

A more complex example of a CSV file with comments is shown below.
It shows how comments could be misinterpreted as part of a field if not handled correctly:

```
#This is a comment
field 1,"field 2 with a # character","field 3
#This is not a comment, but part of the third field that spans multiple lines"
```

## Reading CSV files with comments

When reading comments, FastCSV provides flexibility in how comments are handled.
You may ignore comments entirely by treating them as part of the data, skip them, or read and interpret them as comments.
More information about the `CommentStrategy` enum can be found in the corresponding
[JavaDoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.siegmar/fastcsv/latest/de.siegmar.fastcsv/de/siegmar/fastcsv/reader/CommentStrategy.html).

By default, FastCSV treats comments as part of the data to ensure that no data is lost and to maintain
maximum compatibility with the RFC 4180 standard.

## Writing CSV files with comments

Writing comments to a CSV file is straightforward, as FastCSV takes care of any necessary escaping or line breaks.

:::caution
Be aware that comments are not part of the CSV standard and may not be supported by all applications that read CSV files.
