CSV files are typically used as uncompressed files.
However, compressing CSV files can be advantageous, especially for larger files, as it saves disk space and reduces transfer times.
Depending on the system's I/O performance, working with compressed CSV files can also speed up data processing.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to write and read CSV files with FastCSV using [GZIP] compression:

<SourceExample filename="ExampleCsvCompression.java"/>

[GZIP]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952
