CSV files are most commonly read sequentially from start to end. In some situations, like in graphical user interfaces,
you might need to read specific rows directly without having to read the entire file. FastCSV supports indexed reading
of CSV files, which allows you to navigate back and forth in the file in a random-access manner.

As CSV files do not include an index, FastCSV creates an index while reading the file. This index is stored in memory
and allows you to access rows directly. The index can optionally be stored in a file to avoid creating it every time
you read the CSV file.

:::note
The indexing process runs in the background while reading the CSV file. It is non-blocking, allowing you to start
reading the file while the index is still being created.
A status monitor is available to track indexing progress, making it ideal for graphical user interfaces.
:::

The main API classes and methods for indexed reading are:

```java
// Index the CSV file with up to 5 records per page
IndexedCsvReader<CsvRecord> csv = IndexedCsvReader.builder()
    .pageSize(5)
    .ofCsvRecord(file);

try (csv) {
    // Find the last page in the index
    int lastPage = csv.getIndex().getPageCount() - 1;

    // Output the last page
    List<CsvRecord> lastPageRecords = csv.readPage(lastPage);
    lastPageRecords.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to read a CSV file using FastCSV's indexed reader.
