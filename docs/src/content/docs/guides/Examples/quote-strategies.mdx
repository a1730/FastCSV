Fields in CSV files can be enclosed in quotes.
Although the CSV specification requires quotes only when a field contains a separator, delimiter,
or enclosure character, some applications may always enclose fields in quotes for consistency or simplicity.

From a specification standpoint, these two examples are data identical:

```csv
//example1.csv
"field 1","field 2","field 3"
```

```csv
//example2.csv
field 1,field 2,field 3
```

However, certain use cases may require enclosing fields to convey a different meaning.
For example, this can help distinguish between fields containing an empty string and those with no value at all
(*null* fields).

FastCSV addresses this need by offering various quote strategies.
You may also check the corresponding
[Javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.siegmar/fastcsv/latest/de.siegmar.fastcsv/de/siegmar/fastcsv/writer/QuoteStrategies.html)
for more information.

## Example

In the following example, CSV output is created using different quote strategies.

<Code code={sourceCode} title="ExampleCsvWriterWithQuoteStrategy.java" lang="java" mark={highlights}/>

You also find this source code example in the
[FastCSV GitHub repository](https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV/blob/main/example/src/main/java/example/ExampleCsvWriterWithQuoteStrategy.java).

:::tip
If you want to know if a field is enclosed in quotes when reading a CSV file, you may implement a
custom callback handler. Check out the [Custom Callback handler example](/guides/examples/custom-callback-handler/)
and especially the
[addField() method](https://javadoc.io/doc/de.siegmar/fastcsv/latest/de.siegmar.fastcsv/de/siegmar/fastcsv/reader/CsvCallbackHandler.html).
