Fields in CSV files can be enclosed in quotes.
Although the CSV specification requires quotes only when a field contains a separator, delimiter,
or enclosure character, some applications may always enclose fields in quotes for consistency or simplicity.

From a specification standpoint, these two examples are data identical:

```csv
//example1.csv
"field 1","field 2","field 3"
```

```csv
//example2.csv
field 1,field 2,field 3
```

However, certain use cases may require enclosing fields to convey a different meaning.
For example, this can help distinguish between fields containing an empty string and those with no value at all
(*null* fields).

FastCSV addresses this need by offering various quote strategies.

for more information.

## Writing fields with different quote strategies

In the following example, CSV output is created using different quote strategies.

<SourceExample filename="ExampleCsvWriterWithQuoteStrategy.java" highlights={[/\.quoteStrategy\(.*\)/g]}/>

## Reading quoted fields

To determine if a field is enclosed in quotes when reading a CSV file,
additional work and an extra object per field are required.
FastCSV does not support this feature out of the box, but it can be implemented using a custom callback handler.

<SourceExample filename="ExampleCsvReaderWithSpecialQuotedFieldHandling.java" highlights={['QuotableFieldHandler', 'QuotableField']}/>
